Instructions
A number is "squared" when it is either multiplied by itself or taken to the second power (e.g., 4² = 4 x 4 = 16).

First, ask the user for an integer with int(input()) and store it in a number variable. Then, define a total variable with an initial value of 0.

Note: You can pass a string prompt to int(input()).

Next, use a for loop and range() function to calculate the total of the squares of all integers from 1 to that number.

Last, print the output as an integer value.

For example, if number is 5, the total should be 55 because:

1 ** 2 + 2 ** 2 + 3 ** 2 + 4 ** 2 + 5 ** 2
 
=1 + 4 + 9 + 1 6 + 25
=55

number = int(input('select a number: '))

total = 0

for i in range(1, number + 1):
  square = i ** 2
  total = total + square

print(total)
