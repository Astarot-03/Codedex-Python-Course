Instructions
Use only a for loop with range() and print() to display a staircase of asterisks in the terminal like this:

*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
# ... and so on

Be sure you start with a single * in the first line and end with 24 total asterisks on the last line.

Note: Each * should have a space after it so they're spread out.
